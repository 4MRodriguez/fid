<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

<br>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>

<br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>

<br>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Amazing Gourmet Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="chicken"></a><br>
Our chicken is prepared to order, so be ready to wait at least 40 minutes. It's perfectly breaded and guaranteed to have you coming back! It's definitely worth the wait!</p>

<h2>Our Mouthwatering French Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="fries"></a><br>
Our fries are known throughout the entire nation as the most amazing French Fries to ever be created. With the perfect ratio of crispy to fluffy and a sprinkle of salt, these are the best snack or side!</p>

<h2>Our... Salad?</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="tabouleh"></a><br>
This is our tabouleh salad. One of our chefs tried to make it look yummier by making it not look like a salad, but disappointed guests can confim, it's just sad vegetables.
